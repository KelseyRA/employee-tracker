# employee-tracker

## Description

This application allows for the user to see their personnel database via the command line. The application is started using the 'node index.js' prompt. The user is served a series of questions as what they would like to do. They are able to view tables, add roles, add employees, and add departments. Additionally, they can update current employee's roles. Some functionality still needs work.
